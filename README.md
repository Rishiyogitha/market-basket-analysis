This repository contains a project on Market Basket Analysis, a data mining technique used to uncover patterns in customer purchasing behavior. The implementation is inspired by the work of Aman Kumar, with modifications and enhancements to align with the projectâ€™s objectives. The project leverages association rule mining to identify frequently purchased item combinations, providing valuable insights into consumer buying patterns.
Project Objectives

- Examine transactional data to find frequent itemsets.
- Derive useful association rules based on algorithms such as Apriori or FP-Growth.
- Share perspectives for enhancing cross-selling, promotions, and inventory control.
Features

- Data Preprocessing: Transactional dataset cleaning and preparation.
- Frequent Itemset Mining: Itemset mining with support thresholds.
- Association Rule Mining: Creating rules based on lift and confidence measurements.
